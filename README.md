# Project Description
This project is to build an application to help our customer keep track of all the known squirrels and plans to start with Central Park. We import the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census data and allow customer's team to add, update, and view squirrel data directly and conveniently. 
# Features 
##  Model
  * We build a model to help us import and export squirrel data. It is shown in models.py
##  Import and export data
  * The customer can easily import squirrel data into the application, edit squirrel data in the application, and export data in CSV format.
## Map
  * The map displays the location of the squirrel sightings on the OpenStreets map.
## Data management and update
  * We create a view that lists all squirrel sightings to view each sighting.
  * The customer can update a particular sighting and create a new sighting.
